about: DoR - Entity
DoR is for the PO.

These are standards to which there can be exceptions though they require buy-in from the team.

**DoR - for each User Story**
  
- [ ] Are the Acceptance Criteria defined?
- [ ] Are the dependencies known/ understood?
- [ ] Is this user story small enough to be completed in one Sprint?
- [ ] Dev team accepts UI artifacts? (this is design docs)

Optional:
- [ ] Do we know the audience to demo a user story/ feature? (Sprint Review to all Stakeholders)
- [ ] If there are validation/ business rules, are they defined (UI, Data, Role-Action)?
- [ ] Dev team accepts UI artifacts? (this is design docs)
- [ ] Does User Story need to reference BA-checklist? (are functional/ non-functional descriptions captured?)
- [ ] What do we possibly have to do re Change Management? - e.g. GCPE, training, do we know who is impacted and what that impact is? (this might fit in DoD, or Epic template)

Removed:
- [ ] Is a formal UAT required for this User Story?
