name: Definition of Ready - Entities Team
about: Owned by the Product Owner with buyin from the team, these criteria define when a User Story is ready to be worked on. This state should be the outcome of Backlog Grooming and any exceptions where a ticket doesn't meet this criteria will require buy-in from the scrum team as a whole.
