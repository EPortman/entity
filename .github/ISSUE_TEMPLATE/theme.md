## Owner of the theme
- Branch that will own the finished product

----
## Description (Hypothesis):	
- An elevator pitch that describes the theme

* Problem Statement
* Presentation of Solution
* Value Proposition
* How our solution is different
* (Example) _name of epic_ helps British Columbians _do something_ by _solution_. This will provide British Columbians _value statement_ in a different way than _current solution_. _name of epic_ is better because _differentiator_.

----
## Business Outcome Hypothesis
* Clearly measurable benefits that will be realized when the theme is completed (SMART)
* What does success look like from a business perspective even if the delivered solution ends up being different from what was originally described
* E.g. British Columbians will be able to process requests twice as fast when compared to the existing solution

----
## Leading Indicators
* Early measures that help predict whether the theme hypothesis can be achieved
* What do we need to observe in the first two or three months after the solution is deployed in order to make the decision to continue investing (as opposed to abandon, pivot)

----
## Non-functional Requirements
* e.g. Response time, scalability, recoverability

----
## MVP Identification
* all epics that need to be completed for this theme
