Rocket Chat Tips (From Jason):
Some tips for anyone new to the team and joining RocketChat for the first time (or those wishing to optimize):
- Leave or mute every group not associated with registries (unless you see distinct value for yourself)
- Favourite any person or group you regularly connect with (this brings their names above the clutter)
- Under the Display setting choose to Group By “Unread” & “Favorites”
