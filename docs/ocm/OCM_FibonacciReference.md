### Basic Rules for OCM estimation: 

-	Using Fibonacci to provide estimate for each OCM ticket: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8
-	8 is biggest sizing number for OCM team at this moment 

### Fibonacci Reference for OCM Team

Trish provided below list from previous work we completed and sizing using Fibonacci, this is as a starting point to help with estimation: 

**1** - Simple updates to existing material (i.e., on the website)

**2** - Any typical ticket/activity which we can refer to?

**3** - Creating a new email or communication (i.e., website or announcement), macro, etc.

**5** - Creating forms, Info notes, Job Aides, PowerPoints, creating a change impact assessment

**8** - Delivering training, including train the trainer, creating training videos - could include job aides??
