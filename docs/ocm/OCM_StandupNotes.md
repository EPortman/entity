- Try one person responsible for a certain ZH ticket at the same time, avoid shared assigners/responsibilities 
  - If current assignee has finished his/her part, can add a comment on the ticket and tag to the person who will take next action (**maybe there are also some exceptions here??**)
- Decision is not needed -> Create OCM Ticket Template, and including deadline and other mandate part in the template. While **recommendation is to add dependencies and/or links of design, or output/result in ticket description**
