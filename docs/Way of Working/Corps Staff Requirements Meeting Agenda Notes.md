- Instead of freezing a company, let's make a manual process for alterations to unaffiliate the entity from the new app. (this reduces confusion between freeze and suspend, and low-value development)
- Can we correct a correction? This came up from #6445

- Co-op Incorporation
- Credit union incorporation
- Letters patent
- Dissolutions in general; CPs in particular
-- Voluntary dissolutions create a ledger; administrative dissolution (registrar's purvue) and failure to file do not have ledger.  Any reason why we couldn't have a ledger added saying ADMINISTRATIVE DISSOLUTION or DISSOLVED FOR FAILURE TO FILE?  Devs say this would be helpful for restorations down the road.

- For coop incorporation
   - Special types (housing and community) - separate entity types like CCC, ULC or just a line in the IA output or summary - just a line in the IA not a separate entity type
   - used to record community services ones in COBRS; not housing
   - Staff would use it for reviewing rules and memorandum and also if special res under 178.1
   - Would this ever get changed? 178.1 community service can't change its type.  Have done CP to CSCP; need to check if we can do any change from housing to CP (probably not.  Amber checking). Housing can't become CSCP.  Unlikely ever have to do alterations across types.
   - note: we're going to need corections pretty quickly to replace rules and memorandum. We can't just replace the wrong one with the new one, we need to maintain the history of the incorrect one, when it changed, ledgers of the correction etc. **This would be a good candidate for another nice self-serve correction.**
   - MRAS messaging when incorporated?
   - Under the rules help... under the bullet points (above Subscriber), have a sentence "For more details regarding the matters that must be included in the rules, please refer to section 10 of the Cooperative Association Regulations (link to it).
   - Rules and memorandum certification - number, date and stamp (like societies).  Not sure about the name. Decision: don't put on name to be consistent with societies.
   - question if looking back at an older version will it show the old name (if we display names).  If we put name, should it be current name or name at time of filing?
   - will completing party always be the user ID?  should be


- For amend ledger
    - right now we have 'Add Detail' and just amends one and doesn't create new ledger entry
    - When bringing over still want us to display as an entry ledger called - Amendment - Ledger Information.
    - Need new filing with same functionality as Registrar's Notation (but different name?) yes.

NRO receipt email - changes - see email July 30th
- 1) "If you do not incorporate/register"... - should this maybe say 'If you do not use your name request"?  Not all name requests are to incorporate/register. Julie/Josh/Cam - plain language - 'if you do not use your name request'is better.
- 2) "Thank you for using Name Request Online" - maybe we should call it the Business Registry - Julie/Josh/Cam - yes Business Registry
- 3) "To submit another Name Request".  Should Name Request really be capitalized? No
- 4) Should we remove the 'this is sent from an unmonitored email' because you guys do actually monitor this email? Yes.  But make sure both phone and email option are in the footer; otherwise leave it.

- Ops ticket #7091
- 1)	Keep the output showing ‘registry staff’ or
- 2)	Suppress the output and state available on paper only 
- Decision: suppress output

- Ops tickets re alterations
- filing date
- change of BEN share structure is self-serve

- For coop incorporation
-  1)	Do we need a category “Certain Producer Association”?  This wasn’t raised in any requirements meeting that I recall. - No
-  2)	How would you like to see these coop types labelled in the drop down list and also on the coop summary when it is built?  Would the following work?
      - a.	Cooperative without a special purpose - don't need to know this
      - b.	Special purpose – housing cooperative - don't need to know this
      - c.	Special purpose – community service cooperative
      - d.	Special purpose – certain producer association - don't need this
      - Answer: maybe only have a checkbox instead for community service cooperative (this will need to display on the search eventually)
      - This could reduce corrections.
   3) Need helptext to NOT upload occupancy agreements if you are a housing cooperative
   4) May need helptext to explain what a community service cooperative is.  Text from bcca.coop - Community service co-ops are a designation recognized under the Cooperative Association Act. Under BC law, community service co-ops have a similar status to that of non-profit societies.  Community service co-ops require the inclusion of non-alterable clauses in their rules to ensure they operate on a non-profit basis, and their purpose is charitable, or to provide health, social, educational or other community services - Amber will tweak the wording
- 5) Review incorporation guide - see Aug 6th email.
      - do we need Appendix A in the header
      - change heading to something like this?  The memorandum of association is to be typed or printed clearly on 8.5" by 11" white paper.  Once it has been signed and witnessed, save the memorandum as a PDF electronic document.
      - any other changes?
Question - outputs- what address are they coming from?  If BCRegistries@gov.bc.ca the undeliverables and out of offices can make it unwieldy for business staff to manage.

- **Affidavit & certificate of incorporation, how to fulill the requirements to get the certificate back when they dissolve:**
  - We won't need them to send it back, or certify to destroy it.
  - We can have them upload the certificate, attached to the affivait, in one upload. Staff don't need to retrieve it.
  - if they don't have the certificate, they can include a line in the affidavit saying they don't have it, but if they do, they will forward it to BC Registries.
  - We definitely need to say:
    - it is not valid
    - You should destroy it, or at least not use it
  - These are form provisions under the electronic submissions act. Anything that can be submitted by paper in BC, needs to be able to submitted electonically

- **Co-op incorproation, different types**
- Amber is working on it

-**Co-op incorporation, discuss requiring signature of the rules and memorandum**
- We should have them signed
- If they DON'T sign them, should it warrant a correction filing?
  - Historically we have been taking them signed. 
  - If a citizen looks at their documents and asks why their documents are not signed, how do we repsond? It's not required?
  - I think, due to administrative fairness, we should require a signature, and we should require a correction if they didn't sign it in their incorporation.

- **Co-op incorporation, discuss if we can correct co-ops**
- We will work on this after voluntary dissolution
- We will build the old fashioned colin type of correction where they don't correct a filing, but they correct certain data elements.

- co-op incorporations
  - Go over feedback from training session...
 1. **There is a field in COBRS, you can select if the company is a community co-op, and if it is you can add a paragraph about their community purposes. This field doesn’t exist for any other types. This field is the closest COBRS has to defining the co-op type, but it is only for community co-ops. Also, the field is called REPORTING/COMM, and reporting is used to define what reporting society the co-op reports to. This reporting thing hardly ever used.** - Sienna, can you run this by Julie.  Is this still a need if we are indicating coop type?  I'm thinking the user could download the rules or memorandum to get more info.
    - We do want to keep tabs on which co-ops are reporting co-ops. Clients never need to know if they are or not.
    - Example, if they are a housing co-op, they might report to BC Housing. it is information that we kindof collected in the past, more so for societies than co-ops. It is only internal information.
    - Do we want to record this going forward? We have not recorded it for a while.
    - Sometimes there are provisions in the rules that say the reporting agency needs to approve things, but we don't regulate that.
    - Amber thinks:
      - It is unlikely we will add more reporting co-ops
      - Clients should never see this info
      - When the act is rewritten, we will need to maintain the old reporting association status for the existing co-ops. This will be whittled down over time.
    - ACTIONS:
      - Amber will go through the coop act and draw comparisons between reporting and non-reporting associations
      - Julie will use this info to decide how she would like it recorded it the system
      - Julie will ask Anderson for the existing list of reporting co-op associations
      - Amber will get the list of reporting Societies
  
2. **Can we flip delivery and mailing? Delivery first, mailing second. They can’t have just a PO Box, they need a delivery address for sure.** - Out of scope.  Not changing existing functionality.
3. **Also mailing address says “address cannot be a PO Box” but mailing address CAN be a PO Box, just not delivery address. Maybe this is just a design mistake.** -  can you show me where you saw this?  I don't see it in the BEN IA.
4. **Can we also have a field in the completing party, “corporation or firm”, in addition to the person? It would be valuable to know the firm, if the person belonged to one. Could be optional.** - Out of scope.  Not changing existing functionality.
  Maybe we could pull in the authenticated account name for this?
2. **Same address issues as stated above, in people and roles** - Out of scope.  Not changing existing functionality.
3. **If we are pulling in their BCSC info for their name, can we pull in that same info for their address?** Yes, the name will be uneditable on steps 2 & 5.  The address will be editable in step 2.
4. **Are we showing a thumbnail of the uploaded memorandum/rules? Would be good to make sure they don’t upload the wrong one** - No, not for MVP.  Not available with upload software package we are using - would require several days development work to build new code to support this.  Can revisit after other filings are built.
5. **Can we explicitly state on step 3 that they don’t need to provide their occupancy agreement?**  Yes, what wording and where do they want it?  In the expanding Help with Rules text? Or just above that so it is always visible?  Sienna, I've created #8661 for the cleanup UI stuff.
    - Housing cooperative occupancy agreements are not accepted when filing a cooperative incorporation. The cooperative may store a copy of the occupancy agreement at the registered office.

- **Co-op incorporation cutover period**
 - We originally wanted to give staff the ability to file the coop however this is a lot of dev effort for a minimal amount of filings.  Please file them in COBRS and then we can bring them over from there.
    - Let's discuss a cut-off date. filing in COBRS might be labour intensive, with document uploading and stuff like that. This way we can decide when we can tell clients "sorry please file this online, we will not file it for you".
    - Julie will tell staff: accept manual paper co-op incorp filings up until sept 7th (1week before release). If Sept 7th has passed, send the application back to the client and ask that they file it online. Inform the client that the feature will be live on sept 14th and they will get their documents immediately after the filing is completed (vs having to wait for processing times and documents in the mail).

- **Coop ops ticket re: can't file 2018 AR because filed director changes in 2019. #8637, Rustic Acres**
-  how do you currently handle this with societies
-  how would you like us to handle this scenario long-term?  without data fixes obviously.
-  FYI, I think we've had a couple ops tickets already where we fudged our way through it if it was a correction of staff filings where we made the error.  We'd remove staff-filings and reapply them in order.
-  Janis emailed Julie and Lauren for this info, let's discuss it
      - **Let's wait until we have more info**

- Co-op corrections
   - would staff prefer this to be paper, or self serve with staff review?  Which would be the less risky?
   - need some policy clarification - what is a record (is it a particular document filed) or broadly the information on the coop.  If the former, and there were two records to correct, there would need to be two filings of $20 each regardless of which components were corrected in a record (this is current process).   If the latter, it could just be one filing of $20 and then staff could reference where each error was first created. Would this be useful or just muddy the waters?

- coop dissolution
  - can we make the "dissolve" button much less accidentally clickable? Bright red? Alarm bells?
  - Can we change "business" to "cooperative association"?
  - What do we do about the certificate? Scott will think about a nice UI
  - We need to decide if we want to enter text for the speicial resoltuion, or do we want to upload it
    - Is there an output for both options? Yep we can make one for either option
  - BC Cooperative Association Act should be captialized
  - Let's add "person holding records" to the distribution list of outputs. Maybe add email field to the liquidator/custodian component, make it optional (amber thinks people will object)
  - How do we want the co-op certificate of dissolution? 
    - Let's make it the same as the BCOMP incorproation certification, just for dissolution.

* Do we want to record the "Reporting" field for future co-ops?
* Do we want to keep the "Reporting" field for existing co-ops, and if so, where should staff/clients see it?
* Do we want to retain the co-ops type (just community co-ops) for the existing co-ops?
  * Yes, we definitely want to keep this, this is important information, their funding depends on it. Since we have it, let's not make them enter it again.
* Do we want to retain the community co-ops community purpose that is also entered in COBRS? For existing, or new?
  * Not sure if there is value in collecitng it. It is already in teh memorandum. Not sure where we would see it in the app. Also it might change, how do we facilitate this from changing int he app? Now they can change it by updating their memorandum.
* For existing co-ops that don't have a co-op type defined, do we want them to define their co-op type? Or just collect that for all future co-ops?
  * Amber: doesn't make sense to jump prompt new entities, the set of data would be so small. If there is a push to have thsi data, we should try to prompt existing co-ops to add it. It should be free to add this information, for existing co-ops.

Voluntary Dissolutions
- Corps - Resolution page - yes? Amber with ask Policy for simple language text for resolutions
- Corps - Affidavit page - skip tooltip? - added to designs
- Completing party - collect name and address for outputs or just prepopulate the certify section with user - only prepoulate on the certify section.
- email notifications - label 'completing party' or 'applicant' - completing party
- dissolution certificate - certified to completing party is fine

Coop Incorporation
- step 1 - should not have name translation - correct
- step 1 - don't default 'same as' registered office mailing; in delivery section include" A deliver address cannot be a Post Office box.
- Step 1 - RO Contact info - informational text needs to be changed; change company to business, remove ref to notice of articles.  make generic don't list docs or AR reminders
- Step 2 - director address should not be auto selected
- Step 3 - rules confirm section - should refer to rules not memorandum; remove last bullet (don't need to be signed or witnessed)
- 
- Step 3 - add the following to the expanded help after the "The Rules Need to" section:
- The Cooperative Association Regulations provide a Schedule B template of Rules.  The rules adopted by an association may be in this form, a modified form of these Rules or in another form altogether. 
- The template can be used if:
- the cooperative association will NOT be a housing or community service cooperative association
- the cooperative has share capital consisting of membership shares with par value 
- the cooperative has investment shares that may be issued only to members. 

- Before choosing to use the Schedule B Form of Rules, please review them carefully to decide whether they work for the cooperative association.  
- 
- Link for Schedule B = https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/391_2000#ScheduleB
- 
- Step 3 - memorandum
- see Julie's response Setp 22nd re text

Outputs - IA - why is  the S capitalized - CP3545786 - bbanner name should be capitalized (store and display)
Receipt - why do we have a GST column if we never collect GST

LTDs set up as BENs in error - FYI... email chain Sept 22 - monitor with new changes

- **"Dissolution clause" in the memorandum step of co-op incorp, user research found it confused users. Can we rehash the language around dissolution clause?**
  - We have always said it as optional clause in the memorandum
  - The wording used in the sample is different for each co-op type
  - If none of the samples apply, they can, but are not required to, provide a clause
  - As for defining what will happen to their property after they have been dissolved or wound up - it may be defined elsewhere in the memorandum. If they don't define it in the memorandum, they will need to file a special resoltion to decide what will happen to their property.
  - Let's keep what is in the toop tip for now, but also:
    - Change "property" to "assets"
    - Add another sentence after the current content: "If the cooperative decides to not adopt one of the sample dissolution clauses in their memorandum, the cooperative should put a dissolution clause into their rules. For more information about what a dissolution clause is, contact BC Registries."
    - Change the bullet point to say "There is a Dissolution Provision in the Memorandum or Rules of Association."


- **Review PI mural board - thinking of swapping Firm address change with firm dissolutions.  Easy self-serve and staff filing similar to registrar's order  in that it only needs a dissolution date.  No fees.  Needs an output though.** https://app.mural.co/t/leadingsafetrainingtemplate5894/m/leadingsafetrainingtemplate5894/1620073674738/cab2f4c157615bf630f911c921dd242789344778?sender=u6daebabd77a61fc0a5b75673
  - Addres VS dissolution, which will be more common? We should build the higer volume one first, if we can. Lauren Nixon has the answers, maybe we can get numbers from her. We assume address change will be more frequent.
  - We won't need dissolution in time for forced dissolutions. The forced renewal of firms was miscommunicated in PI planning this morn, the legislative process will take a while, and won't impact our PI decisions. 


- **Business summary - is there a reason why corp summaries don't display share structure and resolution dates?  Do they need to?**
  - Do not display those on corp summaries - they are on the notice of articles.
  - NOA is generated when particualr filings are done. In terms of search, it is a particular special request, so see their NOA and their share structure. There are no legal or policy reasons not to include it.
  - Not reccomended by Amber, too much information in the corproate summary.
  - Julie: What are the corproate summaries used for? For court, banks, ICBC - they don't need share strucure.
  - People who want the last NOA to know the share structure: A shareholder, Law enforcement agencies, CRA, Crimial RCMP
  - Also usually these summaries are one page - this would take it to two.
  - Amber always thought the policy was the basic need-to-know info.
  - This woul also be a change management piece, partners will think its not a corproate summary, and might not accept them.
  - There will be a lot of change to manage, with little value to the people that need these summaries.
  - Also we might get questions from partners/stakeholders who wonder "why do corps have this on their summaries and not co-ops? Where can I see that?" "oh we don't actually collect that.." etc. Easier if we keep the fields the same across all entities. 
    - One difference: Co-ops and Societies have last AGM date, and all other entities don't.
  - Amber's gut is saying "no don't do it"
  - _Let's ask Kat too, about if there would be any added value to anyone if we added more things to the corproate summary._


- Business summary for coops - there was a requirement at some time to state whether it was a reporting coop.  But now that we specify what type of coop do we need that?  We didn't collect it in the Coop IA.
  - Makes sense that we are not collecting it in the Coop IA - we don't want to let users make that error themselves. 
  - We need to discuss this requirements later
    - We think a third party tells us they are reporting or something? Not sure where we get this info, we need to define this. Julie and Lance can look into the files of existing reporting co-ops and societies.
    - Registrar can also order that a co-op can stop or start being a reporting co-op
    - We need to know which ones are reporting or not
    - If they are reporting. It impacts us and things we need to do for this co-op.
    - Maybe only staff, and maybe the co-op themselves, can see that they are reporting? TBD.
    - @Linda, can I add this to the co-op cleanup ticket? Sounds easy, and important. - Yes
  - Based on the previous business summary question, and amber and julie's gut, and also the fact that we will get calls asking about what it is: lets **not** include it.


- Could go over the business summary requirements - we won't do the MVP version, we'll need the full version.  https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/program-space-6148f085cdddca001294333e/issues/bcgov/entity/3821
  - When we build business summaries, we need to make sure we have all the complete and correct date, we can't leave anything out, and we need all the historical data. i.e. we need to build the backend for restorations and all the different types so it can be displayed accurately and completely on the business summary.

- Phone number and email question from Tracey: 

- Understand we don't want to add anything to the business summary, but do we want to add co-op type? **Yes**.

- Corp dissolution application output - dissolution statement on COLIN outputs is: The affidavit required by section 316(1)(a) of the Business Corporations Act has been obtained and deposited in the company's records office.  See sample under 9018 - https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/entity-5bf2f2164b5806bc2bf60531/issues/bcgov/entity/9018
This is different from what we are putting in the UI - the two options on the affidavit.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54917209/136299624-3f578a9e-0990-4ec5-b51a-69b0701a0ec2.png)
Should we 1) remove these statements from the UI? Yes.  2) If we keep them, should they display on the output?  No longer applicable. 
Along with the other statement above?  And should the other statement above also include a resolution required by section... has been obtained and deposited in the company's records office? - Just have the statement above.


- 9453 - what happens with draft filings that staff save?  https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/entity-5bf2f2164b5806bc2bf60531/issues/bcgov/entity/9453 define business process - should staff save drafts?  Kat/Amber - Wouldn't want the company to mess around with a staff draft filing.  Maybe just give company ability to delete it.

- Process for voluntary liquidation for Co-ops... it is NOT the same as a voluntary dissolution. Different steps, fees, etc. Let's talk about them.
  - 
- Insufficient funds for voluntary dissolution? What happens currently if like a cheque bounces for a paper filing?
  - If its a corp and they file it but then later on the cheque bounces, we chase them down. It is hard to do so becuase they don't exist as a company.
  - This might also apply to PAD going forward, since we treat them like cheques.
  - If the Online Banking fails for a voluntary dissolution, in that scenario, the system would not file it. It would stay in draft forever. 
    - This might be particularly bad for dissolutions, when clients think they dissolved but never actually did and now they have multiple outstanding ARs.
    - Linda to ask John if there is anything in place to cancel a payment attempt, and is there any email notification for that? So these clients will be notified that they didn't dissolve?
- Discuss #99
- Discuss #107, co-op missing number, and how we can correct their rules
- #9401

- NOTE: test what happens if an entity becomes not in good standing and they have a dissolution draft. How do we tell them "hey you can't finish that until you do this AR"? They can't have multiple drafts at once, do they need to delete the dissolution?
