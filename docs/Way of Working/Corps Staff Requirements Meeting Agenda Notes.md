- Instead of freezing a company, let's make a manual process for alterations to unaffiliate the entity from the new app. (this reduces confusion between freeze and suspend, and low-value development)
- Can we correct a correction? This came up from #6445

- Co-op Incorporation
- Credit union incorporation
- Letters patent
- Dissolutions in general; CPs in particular
-- Voluntary dissolutions create a ledger; administrative dissolution (registrar's purvue) and failure to file do not have ledger.  Any reason why we couldn't have a ledger added saying ADMINISTRATIVE DISSOLUTION or DISSOLVED FOR FAILURE TO FILE?  Devs say this would be helpful for restorations down the road.

- For coop incorporation
   - Special types (housing and community) - separate entity types like CCC, ULC or just a line in the IA output or summary - just a line in the IA not a separate entity type
   - used to record community services ones in COBRS; not housing
   - Staff would use it for reviewing rules and memorandum and also if special res under 178.1
   - Would this ever get changed? 178.1 community service can't change its type.  Have done CP to CSCP; need to check if we can do any change from housing to CP (probably not.  Amber checking). Housing can't become CSCP.  Unlikely ever have to do alterations across types.
   - note: we're going to need corections pretty quickly to replace rules and memorandum. We can't just replace the wrong one with the new one, we need to maintain the history of the incorrect one, when it changed, ledgers of the correction etc. **This would be a good candidate for another nice self-serve correction.**
   - MRAS messaging when incorporated?
   - Under the rules help... under the bullet points (above Subscriber), have a sentence "For more details regarding the matters that must be included in the rules, please refer to section 10 of the Cooperative Association Regulations (link to it).
   - Rules and memorandum certification - number, date and stamp (like societies).  Not sure about the name. Decision: don't put on name to be consistent with societies.
   - question if looking back at an older version will it show the old name (if we display names).  If we put name, should it be current name or name at time of filing?
   - will completing party always be the user ID?  should be


- For amend ledger
    - right now we have 'Add Detail' and just amends one and doesn't create new ledger entry
    - When bringing over still want us to display as an entry ledger called - Amendment - Ledger Information.
    - Need new filing with same functionality as Registrar's Notation (but different name?) yes.

NRO receipt email - changes - see email July 30th
- 1) "If you do not incorporate/register"... - should this maybe say 'If you do not use your name request"?  Not all name requests are to incorporate/register. Julie/Josh/Cam - plain language - 'if you do not use your name request'is better.
- 2) "Thank you for using Name Request Online" - maybe we should call it the Business Registry - Julie/Josh/Cam - yes Business Registry
- 3) "To submit another Name Request".  Should Name Request really be capitalized? No
- 4) Should we remove the 'this is sent from an unmonitored email' because you guys do actually monitor this email? Yes.  But make sure both phone and email option are in the footer; otherwise leave it.

- Ops ticket #7091
- 1)	Keep the output showing ‘registry staff’ or
- 2)	Suppress the output and state available on paper only 
- Decision: suppress output

- Ops tickets re alterations
- filing date
- change of BEN share structure is self-serve

- For coop incorporation
-  1)	Do we need a category “Certain Producer Association”?  This wasn’t raised in any requirements meeting that I recall. - No
-  2)	How would you like to see these coop types labelled in the drop down list and also on the coop summary when it is built?  Would the following work?
      - a.	Cooperative without a special purpose - don't need to know this
      - b.	Special purpose – housing cooperative - don't need to know this
      - c.	Special purpose – community service cooperative
      - d.	Special purpose – certain producer association - don't need this
      - Answer: maybe only have a checkbox instead for community service cooperative (this will need to display on the search eventually)
      - This could reduce corrections.
   3) Need helptext to NOT upload occupancy agreements if you are a housing cooperative
   4) May need helptext to explain what a community service cooperative is.  Text from bcca.coop - Community service co-ops are a designation recognized under the Cooperative Association Act. Under BC law, community service co-ops have a similar status to that of non-profit societies.  Community service co-ops require the inclusion of non-alterable clauses in their rules to ensure they operate on a non-profit basis, and their purpose is charitable, or to provide health, social, educational or other community services - Amber will tweak the wording
- 5) Review incorporation guide - see Aug 6th email.
      - do we need Appendix A in the header
      - change heading to something like this?  The memorandum of association is to be typed or printed clearly on 8.5" by 11" white paper.  Once it has been signed and witnessed, save the memorandum as a PDF electronic document.
      - any other changes?
Question - outputs- what address are they coming from?  If BCRegistries@gov.bc.ca the undeliverables and out of offices can make it unwieldy for business staff to manage.

- **Affidavit & certificate of incorporation, how to fulill the requirements to get the certificate back when they dissolve:**
  - We won't need them to send it back, or certify to destroy it.
  - We can have them upload the certificate, attached to the affivait, in one upload. Staff don't need to retrieve it.
  - if they don't have the certificate, they can include a line in the affidavit saying they don't have it, but if they do, they will forward it to BC Registries.
  - We definitely need to say:
    - it is not valid
    - You should destroy it, or at least not use it
  - These are form provisions under the electronic submissions act. Anything that can be submitted by paper in BC, needs to be able to submitted electonically

- **Co-op incorproation, different types**
- Amber is working on it

-**Co-op incorporation, discuss requiring signature of the rules and memorandum**
- We should have them signed
- If they DON'T sign them, should it warrant a correction filing?
  - Historically we have been taking them signed. 
  - If a citizen looks at their documents and asks why their documents are not signed, how do we repsond? It's not required?
  - I think, due to administrative fairness, we should require a signature, and we should require a correction if they didn't sign it in their incorporation.

- **Co-op incorporation, discuss if we can correct co-ops**
- We will work on this after voluntary dissolution
- We will build the old fashioned colin type of correction where they don't correct a filing, but they correct certain data elements.

- co-op incorporations
  - Go over feedback from training session...
 1. **There is a field in COBRS, you can select if the company is a community co-op, and if it is you can add a paragraph about their community purposes. This field doesn’t exist for any other types. This field is the closest COBRS has to defining the co-op type, but it is only for community co-ops. Also, the field is called REPORTING/COMM, and reporting is used to define what reporting society the co-op reports to. This reporting thing hardly ever used.** - Sienna, can you run this by Julie.  Is this still a need if we are indicating coop type?  I'm thinking the user could download the rules or memorandum to get more info.
    - We do want to keep tabs on which co-ops are reporting co-ops. Clients never need to know if they are or not.
    - Example, if they are a housing co-op, they might report to BC Housing. it is information that we kindof collected in the past, more so for societies than co-ops. It is only internal information.
    - Do we want to record this going forward? We have not recorded it for a while.
    - Sometimes there are provisions in the rules that say the reporting agency needs to approve things, but we don't regulate that.
    - Amber thinks:
      - It is unlikely we will add more reporting co-ops
      - Clients should never see this info
      - When the act is rewritten, we will need to maintain the old reporting association status for the existing co-ops. This will be whittled down over time.
    - ACTIONS:
      - Amber will go through the coop act and draw comparisons between reporting and non-reporting associations
      - Julie will use this info to decide how she would like it recorded it the system
      - Julie will ask Anderson for the existing list of reporting co-op associations
      - Amber will get the list of reporting Societies
  
2. **Can we flip delivery and mailing? Delivery first, mailing second. They can’t have just a PO Box, they need a delivery address for sure.** - Out of scope.  Not changing existing functionality.
3. **Also mailing address says “address cannot be a PO Box” but mailing address CAN be a PO Box, just not delivery address. Maybe this is just a design mistake.** -  can you show me where you saw this?  I don't see it in the BEN IA.
4. **Can we also have a field in the completing party, “corporation or firm”, in addition to the person? It would be valuable to know the firm, if the person belonged to one. Could be optional.** - Out of scope.  Not changing existing functionality.
  Maybe we could pull in the authenticated account name for this?
2. **Same address issues as stated above, in people and roles** - Out of scope.  Not changing existing functionality.
3. **If we are pulling in their BCSC info for their name, can we pull in that same info for their address?** Yes, the name will be uneditable on steps 2 & 5.  The address will be editable in step 2.
4. **Are we showing a thumbnail of the uploaded memorandum/rules? Would be good to make sure they don’t upload the wrong one** - No, not for MVP.  Not available with upload software package we are using - would require several days development work to build new code to support this.  Can revisit after other filings are built.
5. **Can we explicitly state on step 3 that they don’t need to provide their occupancy agreement?**  Yes, what wording and where do they want it?  In the expanding Help with Rules text? Or just above that so it is always visible?  Sienna, I've created #8661 for the cleanup UI stuff.
    - Housing cooperative occupancy agreements are not accepted when filing a cooperative incorporation. The cooperative may store a copy of the occupancy agreement at the registered office.

- **Co-op incorporation cutover period**
 - We originally wanted to give staff the ability to file the coop however this is a lot of dev effort for a minimal amount of filings.  Please file them in COBRS and then we can bring them over from there.
    - Let's discuss a cut-off date. filing in COBRS might be labour intensive, with document uploading and stuff like that. This way we can decide when we can tell clients "sorry please file this online, we will not file it for you".
    - Julie will tell staff: accept manual paper co-op incorp filings up until sept 7th (1week before release). If Sept 7th has passed, send the application back to the client and ask that they file it online. Inform the client that the feature will be live on sept 14th and they will get their documents immediately after the filing is completed (vs having to wait for processing times and documents in the mail).

- **Coop ops ticket re: can't file 2018 AR because filed director changes in 2019. #8637, Rustic Acres**
-  how do you currently handle this with societies
-  how would you like us to handle this scenario long-term?  without data fixes obviously.
-  FYI, I think we've had a couple ops tickets already where we fudged our way through it if it was a correction of staff filings where we made the error.  We'd remove staff-filings and reapply them in order.
-  Janis emailed Julie and Lauren for this info, let's discuss it
      - **Let's wait until we have more info**

- Co-op corrections
   - would staff prefer this to be paper, or self serve with staff review?  Which would be the less risky?
   - need some policy clarification - what is a record (is it a particular document filed) or broadly the information on the coop.  If the former, and there were two records to correct, there would need to be two filings of $20 each regardless of which components were corrected in a record (this is current process).   If the latter, it could just be one filing of $20 and then staff could reference where each error was first created. Would this be useful or just muddy the waters?

- coop dissolution
  - can we make the "dissolve" button much less accidentally clickable? Bright red? Alarm bells?
  - Can we change "business" to "cooperative association"?
  - What do we do about the certificate? Scott will think about a nice UI
  - We need to decide if we want to enter text for the speicial resoltuion, or do we want to upload it
    - Is there an output for both options? Yep we can make one for either option
  - BC Cooperative Association Act should be captialized
  - Let's add "person holding records" to the distribution list of outputs. Maybe add email field to the liquidator/custodian component, make it optional (amber thinks people will object)
  - How do we want the co-op certificate of dissolution? 
    - Let's make it the same as the BCOMP incorproation certification, just for dissolution.
