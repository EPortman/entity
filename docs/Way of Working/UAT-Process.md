UAT
----

**Note**
- Staff has access to ZenHub
- Users Stories contain business language and staff should be able to understand stories 
- only ask staff to " UAT" changes that impact them directly
- UAT implies that there is an 'acceptance' before going to market
- We don't need acceptance for all changes with staff, but what they need is awareness and understanding so they can support the client. 
- Staff needs to be engaged early on, so staff feel a part of the process and have an opportunity to provide insight and business knowledge that may be needed for the design
- If a change is more complex and impacts the client, staff may need a "hands-on" opportunity to preview the changes prior to going live (not UAT) to ensure they understand how it will be used so they can support the client. 
- During the OCM checkpoint, we review upcoming releases and work on the change plan...part of that planning is asking staff if they would like some hands-on time to preview the changes or UAT (e.g., for a staff filing like Corrections) before going live. 

**Process**



**Entities: - We understand that for Entities:**
PO or BA labels the relevant stories/ ZenHub items to for the appropriate release 
Decision is made which stories/ items are relevant for UAT
John approves going to UAT 
BA (Sienna) sends an Email to CM (Trish) - business language - ... relevant for UAT (?)


**Questions**
- how do we know what item/ stories are relevant for UAT - and how do we make sure it is clear?
- how many days before the release they should start or finish UAT?
- how long does staff need for UAT?
- how are they informed about when they can or should do testing?
