- Review designs
  1. Copy change: "I acknowledge that a sole prop cannot be changed into a GP, a new Name Request is Number and statement of registration...." - let's change it to use what is in OneStop. Replace with:
    - "This is to certify that no other individual is associated with me in this proprietorship. I acknowledge that a Sole Proprietorship cannot be changed into a General Partnership. If this is necessary, a new Name Request Number and Statement of Registration (along with associated fees) will be required."
  2. Need to add "mailing address", also need it to be default UNselected "same as"
  3. Change start date copy text: "Less than or equal to 150 years int he past and less than or equal to 180 days in the future" -> 
  4. Change validation of start date: **waiting on amber to find out more about if you can have a start date in the future, and if it means you need to wait to file it (like a future effective filing) or if it is still effective immediately.**
  5. Nature of Business, more research needed: We were thinking about NOT using NAICS but Janis reminded us that this is used for reporting, Linda is going to ask Carol if we should use NAICS or not. Would be easier for clients to enter free form text, but we might still want reporting from NAICS.
  6. Nature of Business, send nature of business (NOB) back to name request: let's not.
    - It gets prepopulated from name request NOB, and you can edit it for your firm registration, and save it as your firm NOB.
    - Want to keep the NOB the same way it was when the NR was examined, don't want it to be changed after that
    - This seems messy also, staff don't want more bugs for little added value
  7. Let's keep this as "completing party", not "submitting party" so it is the same across entities.
  8.
