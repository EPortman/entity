Is this updated? where do we get the most updated versions? How often are they updated? Do you mind if we merge it together as 1 set of letters and guides, then the registration as a seperate output? That is preferred from a technical perspective.

Finish reviewing requirements doc and questions in the comments: https://docs.google.com/document/d/19nKisnQ9Pw0H8wyIH-YDFeR4S3wAk4gtKlAbDC-KLNs/edit?usp=sharing

**Review designs**
1. Copy change: "I acknowledge that a sole prop cannot be changed into a GP, a new Name Request is Number and statement of registration...." - let's change it to use what is in OneStop. Replace with:
  - "This is to certify that no other individual is associated with me in this proprietorship. I acknowledge that a Sole Proprietorship cannot be changed into a General Partnership. If this is necessary, a new Name Request Number and Statement of Registration (along with associated fees) will be required."
2. Need to add "mailing address", also need it to be default UNselected "same as"
3. Change start date copy text: "Less than or equal to 150 years int he past and less than or equal to 180 days in the future" -> 
4. Change validation of start date: **waiting on amber to find out more about if you can have a start date in the future, and if it means you need to wait to file it (like a future effective filing) or if it is still effective immediately.**
5. Nature of Business, more research needed: We were thinking about NOT using NAICS but Janis reminded us that this is used for reporting, Linda is going to ask Carol if we should use NAICS or not. Would be easier for clients to enter free form text, but we might still want reporting from NAICS.
6. Nature of Business, send nature of business (NOB) back to name request: let's not.
  - It gets prepopulated from name request NOB, and you can edit it for your firm registration, and save it as your firm NOB.
  - Want to keep the NOB the same way it was when the NR was examined, don't want it to be changed after that
  - This seems messy also, staff don't want more bugs for little added value
7. Let's keep this as "completing party", not "submitting party" so it is the same across entities.
8. Confusion on the people and roles step, want the completing party and the sole prop separated more. There is only one person in this entitiy, and that is the sole prop. Wording it like the completing party is part of the sole prop is not good, people already get confused by this. Most staff were confused by that. Linda and Yui to assess this.
  - Also, sometimes the completing party and the proprietor are the same person, but have different addresses. Will that still work?
  - Yes, we will have mailing **and** delivery for these roles. **Need to add that.**
9. Business and company are the same (when adding people & roles), need to make it the same as the corproation flow.
10. Need help text from staff for step 2
11. Ask Amber to check if a sole prop can register with the proprietor being another company that is 1. Not registered in BC, or 2. Not xpro registered in BC. Staff sometimes allow it, but you can't do it through OneStop. Some staff reject it all together. Let's let Amber's decision and implement that.
12. Fee acknowledgement: let's keep this component
