Is this updated? where do we get the most updated versions? How often are they updated? Do you mind if we merge it together as 1 set of letters and guides, then the registration as a seperate output? That is preferred from a technical perspective. ([discussion happening in this email thread, this link only works for sienna](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?zx=nv2aa2snq520#inbox/FMfcgzGlkXvvrGndpNhQHRJZqxTDHlSK))

  - If there are changes to this PDF, then devs need to fix it and test it and release it.
  - How importnat is it for us to attach this as a PDF in the email? Or could we just link it out in the email?
  - If it does have to be a PDF, can it be a sepeprate attachment from the registration output?
    - Lauren thinks it would be better to separate, so the registration statement is more noticable, not missed. People often miss it, delete the email, then they need to order it again.
    - This comes from the minister, Carol, other higher ups, they want it included. They are in the process of updating this letter. I don't think they will want a link.

### Notes from Amber

**Can a sole prop register with the proprietor being another company that is not registered in BC, or not extraprovincially registered in BC?**

This has recently come up with a bank being a person who wanted to register a DBA. Section 88 of the Partnership Act states that “a person… must file a registration statement with the registrar within 3 months after the day on which the business name is first used”. Person is defined in the Interpretation Act as “… a corporation, partnership or party, and the personal or other legal representatives of a person to whom the context can apply according to law”. For the recent inquiry of the bank registering a DBA we were a bit hung up on the fact that a bank is specifically precluded from carrying on business in BC under section 375(3)(a) under the BCA and we therefore couldn’t register it as an extraprovincial company to allow it to register a DBA. In this case it was determined that the “person” (the bank) could provide proof of registration in the home jurisdiction and submit the DBA sole prop registration form for a manual filing. I don’t think it would appropriate for staff to immediately turn manual forms away for entities in this situation – they should be evaluated on a case by case basis to ensure the registrant meets the definition of “person”.


**Can a sole proprietor have a start date in the future, and if so, does it mean we need to wait to file it (like a future effective filing) or is it effective immediately?**

I understand that currently when staff get a paper filing with a date in the future they hold onto it until the start date is closer and One Stop allows for future dated filings up to 180 days in the future. Future dated filings don’t appear to be within the scope of the legislation under section 82 which requires the registration statement to be filed within 3 months after the formation of the firm. Additionally the registration of the firm doesn’t create the existence of the firm itself – it is more a notification that they are formed and conducting business. This is similar to extraprovincial companies that have a requirement to register within 3 months of carrying on business in BC but different than entities incorporated in BC where the incorporation must be effective for the entity to exist – hence why future dated filings are offered under the BCA and require separate fees and filing requirements. Based on this I imagine allowing for a start date in the future for firms was designed to be a convenience factor, whether to allow them the time to open bank accounts/get business licenses, or just so that they would not forget to register with us at all. I also imagine that there is no withdrawal equivalent for a registration dated in the future – and if there is please let me know as this may change my understanding. If there have been no concerns raised from clients in the past surrounding the offering of future start dates, I would suggest continuing to offer them unless the requirements are onerous (such as staff needing to hold on to paper forms for extended periods of time or extensive system requirements to be built).  


**How far in the past can a sole prop’s start date be?**

I’m not sure why the 150 year logic is baked into the One Stop system. As you’ve said, section 82 requires the registration statement to be filed within 3 months after the formation of the firm. Filing outside of this timeframe leads the firm to be out of compliance with the legislation, but with one of the primary purposes of the registration of businesses is so that the public can identify and locate the individuals involved in the business I can understand why we would still want to allow firms to register even if they are not in compliance with the three month timeline – ultimately it serves our purposes by having them on the register, not missing from it because they didn’t register in that three month period. With this in mind, I’d recommend still allowing registrations that are set XX many months or years in the past – perhaps it does not need to be 150 years (this actually seems comically long considering the lifespan of proprietors/partners/companies) but some statistics around registrations can likely be requested to help find the most common periods of time to inform the business decision around the exact parameters to allow going forward.

**Review designs**
1. Copy change: "I acknowledge that a sole prop cannot be changed into a GP, a new Name Request is Number and statement of registration...." - let's change it to use what is in OneStop. Replace with:
  - "This is to certify that no other individual is associated with me in this proprietorship. I acknowledge that a Sole Proprietorship cannot be changed into a General Partnership. If this is necessary, a new Name Request Number and Statement of Registration (along with associated fees) will be required."
2. Need to add "mailing address", also need it to be default UNselected "same as"
3. Change start date copy text: "Less than or equal to 150 years int he past and less than or equal to 180 days in the future" -> 
4. Change validation of start date: **waiting on amber to find out more about if you can have a start date in the future, and if it means you need to wait to file it (like a future effective filing) or if it is still effective immediately.**
5. Nature of Business, more research needed: We were thinking about NOT using NAICS but Janis reminded us that this is used for reporting, Linda is going to ask Carol if we should use NAICS or not. Would be easier for clients to enter free form text, but we might still want reporting from NAICS.
6. Nature of Business, send nature of business (NOB) back to name request: let's not.
  - It gets prepopulated from name request NOB, and you can edit it for your firm registration, and save it as your firm NOB.
  - Want to keep the NOB the same way it was when the NR was examined, don't want it to be changed after that
  - This seems messy also, staff don't want more bugs for little added value
7. Let's keep this as "completing party", not "submitting party" so it is the same across entities.
8. Confusion on the people and roles step, want the completing party and the sole prop separated more. There is only one person in this entitiy, and that is the sole prop. Wording it like the completing party is part of the sole prop is not good, people already get confused by this. Most staff were confused by that. Linda and Yui to assess this.
  - Also, sometimes the completing party and the proprietor are the same person, but have different addresses. Will that still work?
  - Yes, we will have mailing **and** delivery for these roles. **Need to add that.**
9. Business and company are the same (when adding people & roles), need to make it the same as the corproation flow.
10. Need help text from staff for step 2
11. Ask Amber to check if a sole prop can register with the proprietor being another company that is 1. Not registered in BC, or 2. Not xpro registered in BC. Staff sometimes allow it, but you can't do it through OneStop. Some staff reject it all together. Let's let Amber's decision and implement that.
12. Fee acknowledgement: let's keep this component
