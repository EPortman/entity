| 1 | Overall look and feel of UI for "registering a financing statement" should follow the same standards which the other teams are following |  Kaine | Yes, the intent/direction is that the look and feel of the application would be similar across apps. These changes would be visible in the upcoming sprint |
| 2 | Switching between Business and Person should be similar to other apps | Kaine | This would require some co-ordination between the teams |
| 3 | Validation of Business/Corporation through Org Book for both Entities and Assets team | Ian |This is currently not on the Roadmap and hence not part of the minimum viable product  |
| 4 | Auditability of Director Search Results | Kevin | Yes, there would be audit on search results, however access to audited data would be limited based upon who actually needs to see it|
